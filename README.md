# Optics & Acoustics — Course materials

This folder contains course materials (notebooks, data and figures) used in the Optics & Acoustics labs.

Structure
---------
- `00_reciprocalLab/` — Jupyter notebook and data for reciprocal / thin-lens experiment
  - `lab2.ipynb` — analysis notebook
  - `data.xlsx` — raw measurement table used by the notebook
  - `Srel.png`, `InvS.png`, `SoM.png` — generated figures
- `01_colorLab/` — color / Malus law experiments
  - `color.ipynb` — analysis notebook that extracts pixel intensities and fits Malus law
  - `data/` — raw images used by notebooks (Malus sequence, reference images, etc.)

Quick start
-----------
1. Create and activate a Python environment (recommended Python 3.9+).
2. Install dependencies: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, opencv-python

   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy opencv-python

3. Open the notebook you'd like to run in Jupyter or VS Code (for example `01_colorLab/color.ipynb`).

Notes & tips
------------
- Notebooks expect the data files to remain in the provided `data/` folders. If you move files, update the notebook paths.
- The `color.ipynb` notebook contains an image-processing loop that can be slow if you iterate pixel-by-pixel. It is recommended to use the optimized code path (load all images into a NumPy array and vectorize region averaging) if you process the full image grid.
- Figures generated by notebooks are saved (e.g., `Srel.png`, `InvS.png`, `SoM.png`). Commit or move them as needed.

Reproducing fits
----------------
- `color.ipynb` fits Malus law (I = I0 cos^2(theta + a) + b). Make sure angles are converted to radians when using `np.cos`.
- `00_reciprocalLab/lab2.ipynb` fits thin-lens relations and computes averages per measurement (check the first data row is the special So value used as dict keys).
